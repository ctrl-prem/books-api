This project is a RESTful API developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to manage a collection of books. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books, with additional features like pagination, search, and sorting. The API is built with modern web technologies, including Node.js for server-side scripting, Express as the web framework, and MongoDB as the database. Mongoose is used as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, and Nodemon is employed to automatically restart the server on code changes during development. 

The project is structured to promote clarity and maintainability, with separate directories for configurations, controllers, models, routes, services, tests, and utilities. The primary entry point is the `server.js` file, where the Express app is configured and the server is initialized. Environment variables, such as the MongoDB URI and the server port, are managed using a `.env` file. 

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `npm install`. Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB set up in your environment. The API offers various endpoints, including the ability to create a new book, retrieve all books, get details of a specific book by its ID, update book details, and delete a book. Advanced functionalities include pagination through `page` and `limit` query parameters, searching for books by title or author using the `search` parameter, and sorting the results by fields like `publishedDate` or `title`. 

The project also supports basic testing of the API routes using Jest and Supertest, ensuring reliability and correctness. To run these tests, use the command `npm test`. Overall, this project is licensed under the MIT License, and it provides a solid foundation for building and extending a book management API with modern web development practices.
